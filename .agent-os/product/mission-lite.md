# Product Mission (Lite)

B2Chat Analytics is a comprehensive internal analytics platform that helps customer service managers lower response times and increase communication quality by providing real-time insights, AI-powered conversation analysis, and data-driven performance metrics.

B2Chat Analytics serves customer service managers who need to optimize team performance and improve customer satisfaction. Unlike generic analytics tools, we provide B2Chat-native integration with automated synchronization, AI-powered conversation quality analysis using Claude API, and percentile-based performance metrics that reveal true performance patterns instead of skewed averages. Our platform transforms 10+ hours of weekly manual reporting into real-time dashboards with proactive alerts.
