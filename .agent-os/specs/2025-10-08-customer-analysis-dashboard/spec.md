> Spec: Customer Service Analysis Dashboard
> Created: 2025-10-08

## Overview

Implement a dedicated Customer Service Analysis Dashboard that enables managers to manually trigger AI-powered analysis of customer conversations with flexible filters, providing actionable insights into customer journey stages, agent performance, operational patterns, and data-driven KPIs. This feature will transform manual analysis into automated, comprehensive reports that help optimize team performance and improve customer satisfaction.

## User Stories

### Story 1: Manager Analyzes Customer Service Patterns

As a customer service manager, I want to trigger an analysis of conversations within a specific date range and department, so that I can understand customer behavior patterns and identify areas for improvement.

**Detailed Workflow:**
The manager navigates to the new "Customer Analysis" dashboard, selects filters (date range: last 30 days, department: Sales, specific agents if needed), and clicks "Run Analysis." The system processes chat data using AI to categorize customer intents (project information, payment queries, legal documentation, post-purchase support) and journey stages (prospect, active buyer, post-purchase). Within minutes, the manager sees a comprehensive report showing that 60% of inquiries are project information requests, peak interaction times are 9:00-12:00, and Agent Vanessa Palacio handles the highest volume with excellent response times.

### Story 2: Manager Reviews Agent Performance Metrics

As a customer service manager, I want to see detailed agent performance metrics including response times, message volume, and AI-assessed quality scores, so that I can identify top performers and coaching opportunities.

**Detailed Workflow:**
After running an analysis, the manager views the "Agent Performance" section showing a table with each agent's first response time (average and percentile-based), total messages handled, concurrent chat management, and AI-powered quality scores based on response completeness and professionalism. The manager notices one agent has slower response times during peak hours and schedules additional training. They also identify a top performer for recognition based on consistently high quality scores.

### Story 3: Manager Exports Analysis Report for Stakeholder Meeting

As a customer service manager, I want to export the analysis results as a PDF report, so that I can share insights with executives and department heads during strategy meetings.

**Detailed Workflow:**
After reviewing the analysis dashboard, the manager clicks "Export Report" and selects PDF format. The system generates a professional report containing all visualizations (peak time heatmaps, customer intent distribution charts, agent performance tables) and key insights. The manager downloads the report and emails it to stakeholders before the quarterly review meeting, demonstrating the team's performance improvements and areas requiring investment.

## Spec Scope

1. **Analysis Trigger Interface** - Manual trigger with filters for date range, agent selection, department selection, and optional customer/contact filtering.

2. **AI-Powered Customer Analysis** - Claude API integration to automatically categorize customer intents, journey stages, sentiment indicators, and conversation quality from chat messages.

3. **Rule-Based Performance Metrics** - Calculate response times (first response, average handling time), message volumes per agent, peak interaction time analysis, and channel usage statistics.

4. **Interactive Dashboard Visualizations** - Charts showing peak time heatmaps, customer intent distribution, agent performance comparisons, and trend analysis over time.

5. **Export Functionality** - Generate and download analysis reports in PDF and CSV formats with all metrics, visualizations, and actionable insights.

## Out of Scope

- Real-time automated analysis (this is manually triggered only)
- Predictive analytics or forecasting future trends
- Integration with external CRM systems beyond B2Chat
- Automated alerting when KPIs fall below thresholds (may be added in future iterations)
- Multi-language analysis beyond Spanish (initial version Spanish-focused)
- Customer-facing features (dashboard is internal for managers only)

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Functional Dashboard** - Managers can navigate to a new "Customer Analysis" section, apply filters, trigger analysis, and view comprehensive results with visualizations within the B2Chat Analytics platform.

2. **Accurate AI Analysis** - Claude API successfully categorizes at least 90% of customer conversations into correct intent categories and journey stages based on message content.

3. **Export Capability** - Managers can export analysis results as professionally formatted PDF reports and raw data CSV files that include all metrics and visualizations.
