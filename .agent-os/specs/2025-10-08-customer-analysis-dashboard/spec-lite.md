# Spec Summary (Lite)

Implement a dedicated Customer Service Analysis Dashboard that enables managers to manually trigger AI-powered analysis of customer conversations with flexible filters (date range, agent, department). The system uses Claude API to categorize customer intents and journey stages, while rule-based metrics calculate response times and volume statistics. Managers can view interactive visualizations and export comprehensive reports in PDF/CSV formats to optimize team performance and improve customer satisfaction.
